    <h2>About:</h2>
    <p>
      My names are <b>Agbo Chimezie Emmanuel</b>, I'm 20+ years old. Currently a
      student of AltSchool of Engineering Baraka 2025 Cohort, specializing in
      backend. I love learning new stuffs and I'm a fast learner. <br />
      I'm a lover of technology and passionate about programming. In my free
      time, I love to watch movies and listen to music. I'm a lover of football
      but don't watch football games even though I'm a Manchester United fan. I
      know it sounds weird &#128562 but that's me.
    </p>

      <p>
        I look very small physically that people often ask when I will be
        writing JAMB, Even though I graduated from the Federal
        University of Technology Minna, Niger State where I obtained my first
        Bachelor degree in Estate Management and Valuation about 6 years ago. I'm a very
        quiet person but very friendly and I love to make friends. If you
        think its all jokes &#128514, then take a glimpse at the picture below. Diferent
        pictures right? That's because it's responsive to different devices.

        <h3>Below are some media elements used in HTML</h3>

    </div>
    <p>An image element <b>&lt; img&gt;</b> is one of the many media elements that helps add visual spices to our web pages, as you can see, it displays a picture in our web page</p>
    </div>

      <h3>Music &#128189</h3>
      <!-- This is used to add audio files of any format to a web page -->
        <p>
            Music is another media element used in HTML web pages. As I earlier mentioned, I Love listening to music while coding or relaxing. So this media element is one of my favorite in the list of elements. Below is a song from Asake titled "Lonely At The Top" enjoy as you read through this lovely page.
        </p>
      <h3>Asake - Lonely At the Top &#9835</h3>
      <!-- This is used to add audio files of any format to a web page -->
      <audio src="./Media/Asake_-_Lonely_At_The_Top.mp3" type="audio" controls preload="metadata" title="Asake- Lonely at the top"></audio>
    </div>

    <hr>
    <div>
      
      <h3>A video &#128421</h3>
      <!-- Adding a youtube video by simply right click on the video, then select copy embed code option -->
      <video src="./Media/Learn HTML video in 2 minutes ðŸŽ¥.mp4" controls></video>
      <p>Videos are great, especially when it comes to coding tutorials. They are a great way of learning practically. I wrote my first line of code from watching a video tutorial. And i will recommend it at any point in time. A video helps pass information such as inserting a pitch video on a company website</p>

    <div>
      <h3>A GIF or animation</h3>
      <!-- This is used as a container for embedding plug-ins such as flash animations -->
      <div>
        <embed src="https://www.loom.com/embed/315db1f2baec4e6296f8ed0398662470?sid=5740fcd6-ccc0-4bf5-a436-fb40c48c0426" />
        <p>GIF and Animations are very amazing but somehow difficult to create. They involve great skills and patience to achieve it. Like Video element, Embedded elemets of GIF, Animation and youtube videos are used in web pages</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <iframe src="media.html"></iframe>

    <hr>
    <div>
      <track src="./Media/Asake_-_Lonely_At_The_Top.mp3" kind="subtitles" srclang="en" label="English" default>
      <p>Iframes are very important in websites, they help in embedding webpages in a web page for clarity and demostrations. </p>
    </div>
    
    <p>From the above, we can agree that media elements help in creating appealing web page. Thank you so much for reading to this very point. See you next time</p>
